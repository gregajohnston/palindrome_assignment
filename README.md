# palindrome_assignment

This program determines whether a user-provided string is a palindrome (i.e. spelled the same forward and reverse). The program ignores all punctuation, capitalization, and white space.

The program accepts "" as a palindrome, as well as any string of numbers that looks like a palindrome (e.g. 10301).
