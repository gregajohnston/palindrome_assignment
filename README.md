# palindrome_assignment

The "palindrome.py" determines whether a user-provided string is a palindrome (i.e. spelled the same forward and reverse). The program ignores all punctuation, capitalization, and white space.

The program accepts "" as a palindrome, as well as any string of numbers that looks like a palindrome (e.g. 10301).

The 'palindrome_text_reader.py' accepts a text files as an input, provided on directly following the program call on the terminal prompt. The program will test blank lines and return that they are a palindrome, so they should be omitted.
